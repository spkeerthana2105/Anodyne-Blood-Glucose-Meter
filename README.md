Traditional blood glucose monitoring methods have long been a barrier to achieving optimal diabetes management. 
Regular finger pricking can lead to discomfort, pain, and even anxiety for many individuals, often resulting in irregular 
or infrequent monitoring. The non-invasive blood sugar glucose monitor is poised to overcome these challenges by utilizing advanced technology to measure blood 
glucose levels without the need for needles or finger pricks. Instead, we found a new method to find blood glucose with gas sensor by continuously and conveniently.
 The non-invasive blood sugar glucose monitor represents a remarkable advancement in diabetes management. By removing the need for finger pricking and 
offering pain-free, continuous monitoring, this technology empowers individuals with diabetes to take control of their health and make more informed decisions about 
their daily lives
